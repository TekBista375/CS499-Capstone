									<h2>Narrative<br>
									Detail About Project
									</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Inventory management system is a simple web based application developed to manage inventory products/items.
									Basically, this application is sourced from CS360 course which I took previously. Mainly, this application 
									cover up three part i.e. software engineering/design, data structure and algorithm, and database. Using this 
									application, user can login to the system and perform add, view, edit, and delete operation on an item. I hope
									this artifact will showcase my skill and knowledge on software design/engineering, data structure and algorithm,
									and database. Moreover, it also showcase my knowledge of spring boot framework and MVC architecture.

								
								</p>
								<p>
									Basically, this application is developed using spring boot framework and MVC architecture. In designing the front-end
									part of this application, I have used HTML 5, Bootstrap, CSS, and Thymeleaf template. To implement the login and logout 
									features in this application, I have injected the spring security dependency which provided the functionality to 
									authenticate and authorize the user to perform differnent task.Here, I have used MySQL database to store all the 
									perminant data associated with user and items/products. This application also provides the features to search and sort 
									the items. 
						
								</p>
								<p>
									To cover up the algorithm and data structure part of this appication, I have implemented two popular sorting algorithm
									i.e. merge sort and quick sort. Merge sort and quick sort both works on the principle of divide and conquer, but they 
									have their own benefits and drawback. The worst-case complexity of merge sort is O (n log n) whereas quick sort is 
									O (n^2). The main advantage of merge sort is that it works well on any type of data sets regardless of size. 
									Quick sort cannot work well with large datasets, but it does not require any additional storage. In this application, 
									item data will be loaded into a list from database and then sorted using those sorting algorithms. 
								</p>
								<p>
									All the data in this application are stored in MySQL database and the connection between the application and database 
									is done using JDBC driver. Here, I have injected hibernate dependency to map java class with the table in the database.
